[Verse: Ye]
Man, these people took my kids from me, then they closed my bank account
I got so much anger in me, got no way to take it out
Think I'm stuck in The Matrix, where the fuck's my nitrous?
Yes, I am a cuck, I like when people fuck on my bitch
The shit that I'm posting on Twitter, they telling me "Ye, don't say that"
How niggas can't see me in public? I'm driving an all-chrome Maybach
With all of the money and fame, I still can't get my kids back
With all of the money and fame, I still don't get to see my children
Niggas see my Twitter, but they don't see how I be feelin'
So I became a Nazi, yeah, bitch, I'm the villain

[Chorus: Ye]
Nigga, Heil Hitler
Nigga, Heil Hitler (Hey)
They don't understand the things I say on Twitter
Nigga, Heil Hitler
They don't understand the things I say on Twitter
All my niggas godly, Nigga, Heil Hitler (Hey)
Nigga, Heil Hitler, Nigga, Heil Hitler
All my niggas Nazi's, nigga, Heil Hitler
She wanna fuck in Japan, I put the chrome on the Benz
Nigga, Heil Hitler
She reachin' down in my pants, she got the world in her hands
Nigga, Heil Hitler (Hey)
Nigga, Heil Hitler
Nigga, Heil Hitler
All my niggas Nazi's, nigga, Heil Hitler (Hey)
Nigga, Heil Hitler
Nigga, Heil Hitler
All my niggas Nazi's, nigga, Heil Hitler

Nigga, Heil Hitler
Nigga, Heil Hitler
Nigga, Heil Hitler
Nigga, Heil Hitler
